## Getting Started

To get started with **quantspace**, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation:**
   ```
   pip install quantspace
   ```

2. **Getting Started:**

- **Risk measure:**
   ```python
   from quantspace.risk import summary_risk

   returns = [0.065, 0.0265, -0.0593, -0.001, 0.0346]
   summary_risk(returns=returns, risk_free_rate=0.05)
   ```

- **Portfolio optimization:**
   ```python
   from quantspace.utils.datasets import random_portfolio
   from quantspace.portfolio import MarkowitzFrontier

   import numpy as np
   np.random.seed(1234)

   n_assets = 5 # number of assets in portfolio
   n_obs = 1000 # number of observations in data
   return_vec = np.random.randn(n_assets, n_obs) # generate random returns for each asset

   n_portfolios = 500 # number of portfolios to simulate
   means, stds = np.column_stack([
      random_portfolio(return_vec) 
      for _ in range(n_portfolios)
   ])

   # instantiate MarkowitzFrontier class
   m_frontier = MarkowitzFrontier(return_vec, stds, means)

   # plot efficient frontier
   m_frontier.plot_frontier()
   ```
